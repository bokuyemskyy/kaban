rewrite the main file and simplify it again
add async to mix UCI and GUI
create a namespace for each important huge aspect (UCI, Renderer, Movegen, Bitboards etc)
alignas of important arrays
think about removing the arrays with precomputed attackmaps that are easier to compute again, than seek for in memory (pawns, at least)
read something about _mm_popcnt_u64 and SIMD preferences, perf stat -e cache-misses,cache-references
create the universal Movegen::GetAttackPreBB<PIECETYPE>(Square square, Bitboard occupancy)






main first constructs the renderer and Uci and then start, stop;
magics is a member of Movegen
clear out what should be the properties of position, game 
remove utils and put them into some meaningful modules
make a module for textures
