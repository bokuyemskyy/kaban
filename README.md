# kaban - chess bitboard engine

A project, aimed to be a high-performance chess engine that uses bitboard techniques. Inspired by [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/), this project aims to explore efficient board representation, move generation, evaluation functions, and search algorithms using modern C++ practices.

## Documentation
The draft of documentation you can find on here: [DOCUMENTATION](docs/html/index.html)

## Features (Existing and planned)
- âœ… **Bitboard Representation**: Efficient board representation using 64-bit integers.
- ðŸ”„ **Move Generation**: Fast, accurate move generation with legality checks.
- ðŸ”„ **Evaluation Function**: A scalable evaluation function with tuning capabilities.
- ðŸ”„ **Search Algorithms**: Implementation of minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and potentially more advanced techniques like Principal Variation Search (PVS) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).
- ðŸ”„ **Multithreading Support**: Parallel search for improved performance.
- ðŸ”„ **UCI Protocol Compatibility**: Integration with Universal Chess Interface for compatibility with chess GUIs.
- ðŸ”„ **Testing Framework**: Unit tests for move generation, evaluation, and search algorithms.

## Motivation
Inspired by Stockfish, this project is a learning endeavor to deepen my understanding of chess engine development and improve my skills in C++ programming, algorithms, and optimization.
